Tkinter is a powerful UI library included in the python standard library.
Unfortunately, it is hard to customize and looks ugly by default.
This library contains a set of modern themes to improve the look of tkinter.

The themes in this library were developed by rdbende and licensed under the MIT license.

This library makes these themes consistent and easier to implement into an existing project.

This library also has code to implement WidgetFrames, an
expansion on TKinter's label frames that make creating complex
layouts much quicker and more readable.
